-- 1. Maths with String Manipulations 
-- Given a demographics table in the following format:
-- demographics table schema
--      id
--      name
--      birthday
--      race
-- return a single column named calculation where the value is the bit 
-- length of name, added to the number of characters in race.
SELECT bit_length(name) + char_length(race) AS calculation FROM demographics;


-- 2. Bit Length
-- Given a demographics table in the following format:
-- ** demographics table schema **
--      id
--      name
--      birthday
--      race
-- return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed 
-- to the bit length of the string

SELECT 
    id,
    bit_length(name) AS name,
    birthday,
    bit_length(race) AS race
FROM demographics;

-- 3. ASCII Converter
-- Given a demographics table in the following format:
-- ** demographics table schema **
--      id
--      name
--      birthday
--      race
-- return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed 
-- to the ascii code of their first byte.
-- e.g. Verlie = 86 Warren = 87 Horace = 72 Tracy = 84

SELECT 
    id,
    ascii(name) AS name,
    birthday,
    ascii(race) AS race
FROM demographics;

-- 4. Concatenating Columns
-- Given the table below:
-- ** names table schema **
--      id
--      prefix
--      first
--      last
--      suffix
-- Your task is to use a select statement to return a single column table 
-- containing the full title of the person (concatenate all columns together 
-- except id), as follows:
-- ** output table schema **
--      title
-- Don't forget to add spaces.

SELECT concat(prefix, ' ', first, ' ', last, ' ', suffix) AS title FROM names;

-- 5. Padding Encryption
-- You are given a table with the following format:
-- ** encryption table schema **
--      md5
--      sha1
--      sha256
-- Problem is the table looks so unbalanced - the sha256 column contains much
-- longer strings. You need to balance things up. Add '1' to the end of the md5
-- addresses as many times as you need to to make them the same length as those
-- in the sha256 column. Add '0' to the beginning of the sha1 values to achieve
-- the same result.
-- Return as:
-- ** output table schema **
--      md5
--      sha1
--      sha256

SELECT
    lpad(md5, 64, '1') AS md5,
    lpad(sha1, 64, '0') AS sha1,
    sha256
FROM encryption_table;

-- 6. Right and Left
-- You are given a table named repositories, format as below:
-- ** repositories table schema **
--      project
--      commits
--      contributors
--      address
-- The table shows project names of major cryptocurrencies, their numbers of
-- commits and contributors and also a random donation address ( not linked in any way :) ).
-- For each row: Return first x characters of the project name where x = commits.
-- Return last y characters of each address where y = contributors.
-- Return project and address columns only, as follows:
-- ** output table schema **
--      project
--      address
-- Case should be maintained.

SELECT
    left(project, commits) AS project,
    right(address, contributors) AS address
FROM crypto_table;

-- 7. Regex Replace
-- You are given a table named repositories, format as below:
-- ** repositories table schema **
--      project
--      commits
--      contributors
--      address
-- The table shows project names of major cryptocurrencies, their numbers of
-- commits and contributors and also a random donation address ( not linked in any way :) ).
-- Your job is to remove all numbers in the address column and replace with '!',
-- then return a table in the following format:
-- ** output table schema **
--      project
--      commits
--      contributors
--      address
-- Case should be maintained.

SELECT
    project,
    commits,
    contributors,
    regexp_replace(address, '[[:digit:]]', '!', 'g')
FROM crypto_table;

-- 8. Real Price!
-- You are the owner of the Grocery Store. All your products are in the database :)
-- Customer often need to know how much really they pay for the products. Manufacturers 
-- make different sizes of same product so it is hard to compare prices, sometimes they 
-- make packages look big, but the weight of the product is small. 
-- Make a SELECT query which will tell the price per kg of the product.
-- Weight is in grams! Round the price_per_kg to 2 decimal places.
-- Order results by price_per_kg ascending, then by name ascending.
-- Products table schema:
--      id (int)
--      name (string)
--      price (float)
--      stock (int)
--      weight (float)
--      producer (string)
--      country (string)
-- Results table schema:
--      name (string)
--      weight (float)
--      price (float)
--      price_per_kg (float)

SELECT
    name,
    weight,
    price,
    round(price * 1000 / weight, 2) AS price_per_kg
FROM items_table;
